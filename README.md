# Hello Github Pages

You can see my live "website" here: [carsonmckinstry.github.io](https://carsonmckinstry.github.io)

## Need up help setting up?

1. Create a repository in github named `<your github username>.github.io`, just like I've named my repo
2. Find where you are creating your website on your computer. In my case, mine is located at: `/Users/carson/Projects/carsonmckinstry.github.io`. (The name of this folder could be anything. I've just named mine the same as what's in github for simplicty.)
3. Once you've navigated to this folder, run the following commands:

```
    1. git init
    2. git add .
    3. git commit -m "Intial Commit"
    4. git remote add origin -m https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io.git
    5. git push -u origin master
```

4. In your browser, navigate to <username>.github.io, assuming you've got an index.html file in your repository, you'll see the contents of the file. 

**Important: In all instances, where you see \<username\>, replace this with your github username.**
